jpt - Junoplay Table
====================

A database designed for use from applications, similar to Berkeley DB.

The interface is designed to be very straightforward to use, requiring only a
call to "init", "insert" and "close" to create a database file and insert a
value into it.

Each database is represented by a single sparse table, that can have up to
2^32 (4 billion) columns and an "arbitrary" number of rows.

The database employs PATRICIA tries and bloom filters for fast data
retrieval.  Newly inserted data is buffered in a splay tree (as well as a
linear transaction log file) for fast data storage.

Unlike most databases, jpt supports the "append" operation, making it suited
to build indexes.
